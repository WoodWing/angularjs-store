# Installation



You can install AngularJS Store by using your favorite node package manager \(NPM or Yarn\).

Using **NPM**:

```text
npm install --save angularjs-store
```

Using **Yarn**:

```text
yarn add angularjs-store
```

 If you don't want to download and host AngularJS Store yourself, you can include it from a **CDN \(Content Delivery Network\)**. This will expose the `NgStore` class from the global `window` object.
